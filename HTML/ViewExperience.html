    <h5 class="sub-titles">from 7/2020 to 11/2021</h5>
    <p class="prag">Through this course, electronic panels are maintained and programmed, linked to many files,
         and an integrated electronic panel is formed, and it can be linked to cellular devices and linked after electronic and
          electrical tools. The main house of the house is opened and closed through the phone, and the water motor is 
          also operated through the phone, and the phone notifies about a decrease in the amount of water to a certain
           limit of the bowl, and all household chores are transferred to work electronically 
        through the phone or automatically, and this is a simple part of the work carried out by the Arduino board</p>
